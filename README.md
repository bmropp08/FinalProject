# FinalProject
For this project, our group worked to solve, analyze, and visualize a problem using machine learning with the other technologies weâ€™ve learned. 

We will be taking real estate data to predict houseing values in a specific area. After further exploration, it is apparant that there are many outliers that affect the predicatibility. Many different models, including linear regression, random tree, neural networks, and K nearest neighbors are investigated to parse through the dataset.  



Requirements and points:

A Python script initializes, trains, and evaluates a model (10 points)
The data is cleaned, normalized, and standardized prior to modeling (5 points)
The model utilizes data retrieved from SQL or Spark (5 points)
The model demonstrates meaningful predictive power at least 75% classification accuracy or 0.80 R-squared. (5 points)
The model optimization and evaluation process showing iterative changes made to the model and the resulting changes in model performance is documented in either a CSV/Excel table or in the Python script itself (15 points)
Overall model performance is printed or displayed at the end of the script (10 points)
GitHub repository is free of unnecessary files and folders and has an appropriate .gitignore in use (10 points)
The README is customized as a polished presentation of the content of the project (15 points)
All group members speak during the presentation. (5 points)
Content, transitions, and conclusions flow smoothly within any time restrictions. (5 points)
The content is relevant to the project. (10 points)
The presentation maintains audience interest. (5 points)
